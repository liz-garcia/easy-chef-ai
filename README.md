# EasyChefAI

## Description

EasyChefAI is a React single-page application designed to assist users in deciding what to cook. Users can input their own ingredients and categories, and the application generates a recipe using the OpenAI API. The resulting recipe is presented in a user-friendly manner, accompanied by visually appealing images generated using OpenAI's ChatGPT and DALL-E 3.

### Features

- **User Data Management:**
  - The app remembers the user's name and can store user data through a `UserContext`.
  
- **OpenAI API Integration:**
  - Utilizes a custom hook (`useOpenAIRecipe.js`) to handle requests for both image and text generation based on user input.

- **Theme Management:**
  - Includes a button to toggle between dark and light mode.
  - Recognizes the theme of the user's device and applies it to the site.

- **Animations:**
  - Incorporates soft animations for a more engaging user experience.
